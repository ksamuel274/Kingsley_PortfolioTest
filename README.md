## Biography
*I'm a born and raisied New Yorker from Brooklyn. Since a teen, I've had extreme interest in developing and evolving technology. From the first computer I tore apart and broke to current day me learning and programming in multiple languages, technology has shaped the way I interact with the world and how I connect with people. I'm a current undergrad at CUNY Brooklyn College pursing a BS in Computer Science. My goal after completing my undergrad is to become become a Data Scientist. Here in my portfolio lies some of the projects I have worked on as a student and even some experimenting I've done on my free time.*

## Computer Science
*Within my Computer Science journey I have learned Languages such a R, Python, and Java. Learning new languages have been quite interesting and fun. Languages tend to use very similar concepts overall th*

## Data Science
*I found out about Data Science during CUNY's 90 Day Challenge which provided access to a plathora of Coursera courses. It peeked my interest because it doesn't rely on just your computer science skills, but a combination of computer science, statistics and business. It's a field of study which is not really discussed within school, but fortunately Brooklyn College has added Data Science as a minor which I have decided to enlist in to. I've taken time to learn ML and studied Big Data concepts in order to develop skills to pursue Data Science as a Career.*
