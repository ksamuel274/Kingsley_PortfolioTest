## Biography
* I'm a born and raisied New Yorker from Brooklyn. Since a teen, I've had extreme interest in developing and evolving technology. From the first computer I tore apart and broke to current day me learning and programming in multiple languages, technology has shaped the way I interact with the world and how I connect with people. I'm a current undergrad at CUNY Brooklyn College pursing a BS in Computer Science. My goal after completing my undergrad is to become become a Data Scientist. Here in my portfolio lies some of the projects I have worked on as a student and even some experimenting I've done on my free time.
